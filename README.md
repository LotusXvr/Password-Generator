# PasswordGenerator
This is a program that lets you input what you want on your password and create a pretty safe and hard do crack password.
It has an option to create passwords with the amount of characters that you decide as well as creating multiple passwords in one request.
It lets you decide if your password will have uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.

Im a complete beginner to python, it might be really noticeable in the code, so if you catch any error with the program, let me know!
I did my best to get the minimum amount of errors, but no program is error proof, im i right?

Feel free to use this simple program that i made with much attention!
